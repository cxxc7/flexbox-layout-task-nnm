            <h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
            <!-- Main content goes here -->
            <p>NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be replicated.</p>
            <h2>How do they work?</h2>
            <p>NFTs are typically created, bought, and sold on blockchain platforms that support the Ethereum blockchain, although other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Flow are also gaining popularity for NFT transactions. Each NFT contains metadata that provides information about the asset it represents, such as its title, creator, and a link to the digital file.</p>
            <h2>Benefits of NFTs</h2>
            <p>NFTs offer several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ownership and Authenticity: NFTs allow creators to prove ownership and authenticity of their digital creations in a transparent and immutable way.</li>
                <li>Monetization: Artists, musicians, and other creators can monetize their work directly through the sale of NFTs, bypassing traditional intermediaries.</li>
                <li>Interactivity: NFTs can enable new forms of interaction and engagement between creators and their audience, such as unlockable content or participation in virtual events.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Examples of NFTs include digital art, collectibles, music albums, virtual real estate, and even tweets or memes. Some notable NFT sales have reached millions of dollars, attracting attention from collectors, investors, and the media.</p>
